      "prompt": "I like Bollywood dances, can you recommend good Bollywood movies?",
      "winner": "orchestrator",
      "reason": "The orchestrator provides a more comprehensive and well-structured list of movies. It gives a short description and lists key dance sequences for each film, which is exactly what the user is looking for. The baseline's response is good, but the formatting is not as clean, and the list is not as extensive."

      "id": "pure_research",
      "prompt": "What plants are good for indoor air purification?",
      "winner": "orchestrator",
      "reason": "The orchestrator's response is more helpful. Both responses correctly state that the information is not available in the provided context. However, the orchestrator's response goes a step further by providing related information that the user might find useful, which is a better user experience."

    {
      "id": "preference_only",
      "prompt": "I really enjoy cooking Indian food.",
      "winner": "orchestrator",
      "reason": "The user makes a statement about a hobby. The orchestrator's response is conversational and acknowledges the user's statement in a positive and encouraging way. The baseline's response is a non-sequitur, providing a file path that seems to be for a recipe, which the user did not ask for. The orchestrator provides a much more natural and appropriate response."

      "id": "out_of_scope",
      "prompt": "Tell me about the weather in New York.",
      "winner": "orchestrator",
      "reason": "The orchestrator's response is much more helpful. Both responses correctly state that they cannot answer the user's question. However, the orchestrator goes a step further by providing a detailed list of topics it *can* discuss, complete with examples from the provided context. This proactive and helpful approach makes for a much better user experience."

    {
      "id": "ambiguous",
      "prompt": "I like movies and plants. Any suggestions?",
      "winner": "baseline",
      "reason": "The baseline response is better because it answers both parts of the user's prompt, providing suggestions for movies and plants. The orchestrator response only provides movie suggestions and incorrectly states that no information on plants is available."
