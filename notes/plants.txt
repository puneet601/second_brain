### 📝 Notes & Tips:

* These plants reflect *traditional and ethnobotanical knowledge* in the Bathinda / Malwa region. ([cuestionesdefisioterapia.com][4])
* Local climate in Bathinda is semi-arid; when cultivating, consider soil type, heat tolerance, and water-availability.
* For your hobby / intentional living goals, you could pick 3–5 of these to **grow at home**, document their growth, learn uses and local lore — which aligns with your interest in building knowledge/hobby.
* When using medicinal plants: **Always confirm proper identification**, proper parts (root, leaf, bark), dosage, compatibility with any health conditions you have (you mentioned PCOS, allergies).
* Since you have dust allergies and other health goals—plants that support immune health (like Ashwagandha, Neem), anti-inflammatory ones (Turmeric) may be more aligned, but again, use with caution and under guidance.
